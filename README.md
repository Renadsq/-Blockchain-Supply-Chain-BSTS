# Blockchain Supply Chain Tracking System (BSTS)

This project presents a blockchain-based supply chain tracking system developed as part of the **ICS 440 – Blockchain Technologies** course.

The system demonstrates how blockchain can be used to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust in supply chain processes by recording product movements and transactions in an immutable distributed ledger.
